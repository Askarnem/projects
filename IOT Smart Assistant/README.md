# IOT Smart Assistant
## IDEA
### The aim of our project is to connect IoT appliances with a NLP-algorithm such that one is able to operate IoT devices seamlessly and intuitively. Common items include Smart Speakers (Alexa), Smart TVs (Android TV), Wifi-connected Air Conditioning, Automated Vacuum Robots, etc. The aim is to use NLP as the primary input of various IoT's UI/UX alongside modular model design.
